Description: Estimate the incubation period and its association with risk factors
    when the exact dates of infection and symptomsâ€™ onset may not be observed.
    The generalized odds-rate class of regression models, which is one of the 
    sufficiently general parameteric classes, is employed for modeling the 
    incubation period for infectious diseases. The observed data must include
    the period of potential exposure and times for symptom onset or hospitalization.
