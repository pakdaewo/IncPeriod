# IncPeriod

## I. Description
The package provides the tools for estimating the incubation period and its association with risk factors when the exact dates of infection and symptomsâ€™ onset may not be observed, which is written in the programming language R <https://www.r-project.org>. 

## II. Installation
You can install the package by typing the following codes:

```r
library(devtools)
install_github("pakdaewo/IncPeriod")

library(IncPeriod)
?IncPeriod
```

## III. Implementation
The following information must be inputted into the main function 'IncPeriod'.

* date.exposure: a numeric matrix of patients' exposure periods. The first and second columns are start dates and end dates of the exposure, respectively.
* date.onset: a numeric vector for the exact date of symptom onset. Use NA for missing cases.
* date.hosp:  a numeric vector for the exact date of hospitalization. Use NA for missing cases.
* X: a numeric matrix for patient's covariates

Note that either date.onset or date.hosp must be provided for each patient. 


## IV. Example (covid19)

```r
library(IncPeriod)
data(covid19)

date.exposure <- covid19[, 1:2]
date.onset <- covid19[, 3]
date.hosp <- covid19[, 4]
X <- covid19[, 5:6]

res <- IncPeriod(date.exposure, date.onset, date.hosp, X)
res

summary(res)
# cplot(res, X = c(age = 42, gender = 1)) # run this code for drawing the cumulative probability of the incubation period
```
